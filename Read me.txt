The precipitation data is from the WorldClim v1.4 database:
http://www.worldclim.org/
It the total precipitation in January in mm (interpolations of observed data, representative of 1960-1990).


The data points are some point I am using on my current research (http://www.alicialedo.com/current-research/)
with no information apart from the coordinates

any question, please contact me: alicialedo@gmail.com
